A minimal, developer-friendly clone of Airbnb focused on core booking functionality: listings, search, booking, user auth, and reviews. Built for learning, rapid prototyping, or as a starter kit for marketplace-based rental apps.

🚀 Project Goal

Provide a compact, well-organized codebase that demonstrates the essential building blocks of a short-term rental platform: listing creation, availability/calendar handling, booking flow, and basic payments (mocked). Designed for clarity and easy extension.

✨ Key Features

User registration & authentication (email + password)

Host flow: create, edit, and manage listings (title, photos, price, amenities)

Search listings by location, date range, and guest count

Availability and simple calendar blocking

Booking flow: request booking -> host approval (optional) -> confirmed

Reviews & ratings

Simple user dashboard (bookings, hosted listings)

Mock payment integration (stripe sandbox or local stub)
